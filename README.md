Before understanding anything we need to understand what a neural network is doing. 
A neural network learns to identify any pattern based on the training data and formulates an approximation function that tries to fit that training data to predict some output. 
Ultimately it is trying to formulate a function. 

This project investigates the application of Taylor polynomial feature maps to expedite the learning process in neural networks. 
The core idea lies in leveraging Taylor series, a mathematical tool for approximating functions, to provide an initial guess for the complex patterns a neural network aims to capture.

By incorporating a Taylor feature map, the neural network is essentially provided with a more informative initial representation of the data. 
The Taylor series, through its polynomial expansion, captures local structure and trends within the data. This "head start" allows the network to better understand the underlying patterns and relationships 
in the data, leading to faster convergence and improved generalization performance. 
In essence, the Taylor feature map acts as a powerful prior, guiding the network towards a more optimal solution and reducing the amount of training data required to achieve comparable results.

## 1. Understanding Taylor Series Expansion

The Taylor series expansion of a function *f(x)* around a point *a* is given by:

`f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + (f''(a)/2!)(x-a)^2 + (f'''(a)/3!)(x-a)^3 + ...`

`= ∑[n=0 to ∞] (fⁿ(a)/n!) * (x-a)^n`,

where:

* *fⁿ(a)* represents the nth derivative of *f(x)* evaluated at *x = a*.
* *n!* denotes the factorial of *n*.

In essence, the Taylor series expresses a function as an infinite sum of terms calculated from its derivatives at a specific point.

In my case I had used center point as 0. and made my expansion as equal to expansion of `e^x` at `a=0` 
`=> f(x) = x^0 + x^1 + x^2 +...+ x^n` `(0<= n < inf)`  

**Applications:**

* **Approximation:** Taylor series can be used to approximate functions, especially near the point of expansion.
* **Numerical Analysis:** They are crucial in numerical methods for solving differential equations and performing numerical integration.
* **Calculus and Analysis:** Taylor series provide insights into the behavior of functions, such as convergence and singularities.

## 2. Taylor Series as a Head Start for Neural Networks

While neural networks excel at learning complex patterns from data, the initial learning stages can be slow. Taylor series come into play by providing an initial approximation of the function 
the network is trying to learn. This approximation serves as a "head start," guiding the network towards the optimal solution more efficiently.

## 3. Implementation Details

* **Taylor Feature Map Generation:**
   - The code defines a function `taylor_series_features` that computes the Taylor series expansion of the input vector up to a specified degree.
   - This function serves as the foundation for creating the "Taylor Feature Map," which acts as an initial feature representation for the neural network.

* **Model Architecture:**
   - A sequential neural network with Dense layers and ReLU activations is employed.
   - The input layer is Dense layer with 16 units in case of random polynomial function approximation, on the other hadn need to flattened to accommodate the Taylor Feature Map as input in case of Image approximation.
   - The final layer uses linear activation incase of data points (random polynomial function approximation) and a sigmoid activation in case of image pattern approximation
   - to map the output to the range of [0, 1], matching the normalized pixel values of the image.

* **Training and capturing learning progress at each epoch:**
   - The Taylor Feature Map is fed as input to the neural network for training.
   - The `SaveReconstructedImageCallback` class is used to visualize the reconstructed image after each training epoch.
   - This visualization aids in monitoring the learning progress and assessing the effectiveness of the Taylor Feature Map.

* **Faster Convergence:** By providing an initial guess close to the optimal solution, Taylor series can significantly accelerate the learning process of neural networks, especially for complex functions.
* **Reduced Training Time:** Faster convergence translates to reduced training time, making the overall learning process more efficient.

## 5. Considerations and Future Work

* **Degree Selection:** The choice of the degree for the Taylor series expansion is crucial. A low degree might not provide a sufficient approximation, while a high degree can lead to overfitting. Techniques for optimal degree selection can be explored.
* **Alternative Feature Maps:** The investigation of other feature maps derived from mathematical tools or domain knowledge can be a promising direction for further research.

## 6. Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of Taylor polynomial feature maps in accelerating the learning of neural networks. 
The results showcase a reduction in training time compared to traditional neural network approaches. Future work can delve into more sophisticated feature map generation techniques and explore their 
impact on various neural network architectures and tasks.
